\chapter{Reinforcement learning methodology}
\label{chapter:learning}
\todo[inline]{think of renaming this chapter to be less generic, more focussed on my project}

- the point of this chapter is to:
  - describe how the different policies have been designed (defo GNN, maybe LSTM, hopefully iter)
  - have some nice diagrams of the policy design maybe?
  - talk about modifications/translations of observation and action spaces to make them usable
  - talk about GNNs (encode -> process -> decode) and why (can vary obs + action size!)
  
 \section{Introduction}
 
- give a short into to why this chapter exists, what it seeks to do

\section{Environment interface}

- talk about the interface to the environment and how it needed modifying (i.e. gamma, squishing DMs etc)

\section{Standard policies}

- quick bit about the MLP and LSTM baselines
- mention the thinking behind them
- mention why they are not enough for generalisation

\section{GNN policy}

- first give summary paragraph
- then talk about how GNNs work
- then talk about encode process decode model
- then talk about how inputs are set and outputs derived

\section{Iterative GNN policy}
(may have to cut this section unfortunately depending on how everything goes)
- first give summary paragraph
- then mention placeto
- then talk about node/edge embedding
- then talk about more shit
