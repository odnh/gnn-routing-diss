\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}
\todo{write whole chapter. Idea: do the graph linky thing from Q-Jump paper (but only if time and after all else is complete)}

\subsection{Aims}
\todo{Give (and discuss) goals of what eval seeks to show (should map onto contributions given earlier). Talk about progressive randomisation include the definition table). summarise what experiments will be performed}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\todo{training set up. hyperparameter tuning (cite). specifics of agent used (cite). callbacck with reference to DM generation methodology earlier}


\subsection{Baselines}
\todo{just a callback to their earlier descrip with reference (mlp \& lstm). also introduce Raeke routing}


\subsection{Learning static routing}
\todo{talk about single sequence, single cycle (all should work)}


\subsection{Learning cyclic routing}
\todo{talk about adding cycles and training on one / multiple seqs. Still only test from training set though}


\subsection{Generalising to unseen sequences}
\todo{talk about changing just the dms, changing the cycle length, even changing dm type}


\subsection{Generalising to unseen graphs}
\todo{mention again why nnot comparing mlp here. mention why important (drop node/link etc, ref earlier). do drop/add node/link. do gen from same distribution. do out of distribution (will probs fail but is good to show)}

\subsection{Real world}
\todo{test on TOTEM/Abilene with cross-fold validation}
